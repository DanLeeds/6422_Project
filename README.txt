Project Overview:

Title: "The Income Equation: Unpacking the Roles of Experience and Education"

Objective: This project aims to investigate and elucidate the influence of experience and education on income, utilising data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Our goal is to understand whether either of these factors contribute to income differences among individuals in the tech industry.

   - `README.txt`: Provides a brief description of the project, it's purpose, and the contents of each folder.
   
2. `raw` folder: Contains one .zip format file titled - stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.zip - which unpacks into the two CSV files, pdf, and txt file listed below. The unzipped data file is too large to be hosted on github, therefore, THE ZIP FILE MIUST BE UNZIPPED FOR ANY FURTHER ANALYSIS OR VISUALISATION TO WORK.
